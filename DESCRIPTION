Description: Utility functions to retrieve data from the UK National River Flow
  Archive (<https://nrfa.ceh.ac.uk/>, terms and conditions:
  <https://nrfa.ceh.ac.uk/costs-terms-and-conditions>).
  The package contains R wrappers to the UK NRFA data temporary-API. There are
  functions to retrieve stations falling in a bounding box, to generate a map
  and extracting time series and general information. The package is fully
  described in Vitolo et al (2016) "rnrfa: An R package to Retrieve, Filter and
  Visualize Data from the UK National River Flow Archive"
  <https://journal.r-project.org/archive/2016/RJ-2016-036/RJ-2016-036.pdf>.
